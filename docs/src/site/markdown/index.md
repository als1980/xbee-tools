# XBee/ZigBee Java Tools

XBee/ZigBee Java API and tools based on [Netty](http://www.netty.io).

This library can be used at different levels:

* on a high level, this is a Java API for XBee modules (*highly experimental at the moment*),
* on a low level, this is a bunch of Netty handlers allowing you do whatever you need,
like a [COSM gateway](examples/cosm.html) for example.

---

*This stuff is still work in progress.*

*Highly unstable right now!*

Please note that only XBee/ZigBee modules configured to use API level 1 works with these tools.

There is right now only basic support of XBee Series 2 modules.
